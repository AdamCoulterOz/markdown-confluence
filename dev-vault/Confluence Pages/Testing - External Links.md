### Links

#### External links

Markdown style links can be used to refer to either external objects, such as web pages, or an internal page or image.

```md
http://obsidian.md - automatic!
[Obsidian](http://obsidian.md)
```

#### Obsidian URI links

[[Using Obsidian URI|Obsidian URI]] links can be used to open notes in Obsidian either from another Obsidian vault or another program.

For example, you can link to a file in a vault like so (please note the [[Using Obsidian URI#Encoding|required encoding]]):

```md
[Link to note](obsidian://open?path=D:%2Fpath%2Fto%2Ffile.md)
```

[Link to note](obsidian://open?path=D:%2Fpath%2Fto%2Ffile.md)

You can link to a note by its vault name and file name instead of path as well:

```md
[Link to note](obsidian://open?vault=MainVault&file=MyNote.md)
```

[Link to note](obsidian://open?vault=MainVault&file=MyNote.md)

#### Escaping

If the URL contains spaces, you can escape them by replacing them with `%20`.

```md
[Export options](Pasted%20image)
```

[Export options](Pasted%20image)

Or you can enclose the target in `<>`, such as:

```md
[Slides Demo](<Slides Demo>)
```

[Slides Demo](<Slides Demo>)
