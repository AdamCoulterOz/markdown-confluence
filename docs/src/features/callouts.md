Both normal and foldable callouts are supported. 

Normal callouts are converted to a [Panel](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/insert-the-info-tip-note-and-warning-macros/). 
Foldable callouts are converted to [Expand Macro](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/insert-the-expand-macro/). These don't support the colors and formatting that Panels do. 

Due to Confluence restrictions Nested Callouts aren't supported.
